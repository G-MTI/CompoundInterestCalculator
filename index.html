                <p>Compound interest is a financial mechanism in which the interest accrued on an initial principal is periodically added to the principal itself, so that in subsequent periods the interest is calculated not only on the original principal but also on the interest already accumulated.</p>
                <p>Means you earn interest not just on your original money, but also on the interest that money has already made. Over time, this makes your money grow faster.</p>
